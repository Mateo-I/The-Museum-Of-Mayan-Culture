          <h2>Exhibit 1</h2>
          <p>This exhibit teaches you about what Mayan culture and life was like. This is to teach people the basics before they get into the rest of the museum and start learning about the topics. The included artifacts are pictures / infographics with explanations of what was happening in this time that are organized into this wide pathway, a view overlooking the surrounding Mayan structures with key locations pointed out, an indoor balcony looking down onto the excavation site and other floors down below, and a VR / Video tour talking about the Mayan empire. There is also a map on the floor pointing out different parts of their culture (you could also look at the model from the balcony). These help show what it was like back in the day by giving you an image of what their daily lives were and showing you models and the structures that they would live around. This room is built with balconies so you can get a better view of the models and look down on them to see how life was. You can also overlook the Mayan cities and see diagrams and pictures of how it would have looked and how the different parts functioned.</p>

        <div id="exhibit-2" class="exhibit-content">
          <h2>Exhibit 2</h2>
          <p>This exhibit helps spread light on how the Mayans deforestation ended up affecting them for the worse, and how they should had used sustainable practices. This exhibit has the tools that the Mayans used to farm with, an outside garden that shows the difference of what it looked like before the Mayans did anything to it and after they had cultivated it, infographics on how this deforestation was bad for them in the long run, a miniature model that people can walk through to see the different Mayan farming practices from above (because other than deforestation, it was pretty sophisticated). These artifacts and models help show you how over farming affected them in easy ways to understand while also learning about the Mayans achievements that they had in farming. The design of the room is open because of all the big models in there helps people move around the room while still seeing everything they need to see.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="exhibit-3" class="exhibit-content">
          <h2>Exhibit 3</h2>
            <p>This exhibit helps teach about how there were really big difference in the lifestyles of slaves compared to the nobles or people with more power. This room has a lot of infographics showing and comparing how people in different classes lived, artifacts of different tools that slaves used, a section that has short videos where people act out different tasks and day to day lives of the different classes, artifacts depicting Mayan writing and the number zero, and how the Mayans used astronomy. This room also has an open area in the room for an excavation sight that is sometimes going on, this exaction sight is looking for tools and remanence of information for how people enslaved in the Mayan empire lived. These artifacts help people see how the rich were able to do a lot more than the slaves while the slaves also did a lot more manual labor. The room is designed in two sections where one half was talking about slaves while the other half would talk about the nobles, which would help show how the nobles and slaves were separated and how the nobles had a lot more things that they could do in life.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="exhibit-4" class="exhibit-content">
          <h2>Exhibit 4</h2>
          <p>This exhibit shows the connection that the Mayans had to modern day, with there still being deforestation and unsustainable farming practices happening today. This exhibit has infographics for places like the Amazon, Indonesia, Brazil, and shows how they have used deforestation. It also teaches how different pesticides and farming choices that the United States uses are also unsustainable and bad for the environment. It also has an interactive map that you can click on and change what info it is showing using a few buttons and a tablet. It would also have different tools and products that are used today showing how much more advanced we got while still being unsustainable. Finally, it has a video room where you can watch videos of drones flying through fields (can be VR) and see how the farming process works. The design includes a pathway with all the infographics that we have and seats to view and read those infographics. We also have accompanying pictures or videos to go along with the infographics. The rest of it is somewhat open with it leading you down this pathway so you get to see everything.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="exhibit-5" class="exhibit-content">
          <h2>Exhibit 5</h2>
          <p>how social equity still affects us today, with racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia present, wage disparities and pay, and healthcare. The items in this exhibit are infographics about different places and how they are affected by topics involving social equity with it being organized the same as exhibit four with the open pathway. It includes a section where you can watch different stories or videos of different places on a tablet. It also has a map that has a tablet to go with it, that lets you click the different countries and look at stats and see where to learn about this and you can also learn where to help support people in that country. These help teach about social equity because you get to learn about it first hand and see what is happening. The design of the exhibit is roughly the same, but it is focused on a different topic.</p>
